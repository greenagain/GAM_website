            PAID TRANSACTIONS
            Paid transactions (e.g., for membership subscription fees or purchase of goods) are made by Green Again or a third party identified at the time of sale, if different. If you have questions about your transaction, please contact Green Again (or third party) at the address provided and they will assist you. Different or additional terms and conditions may apply to third parties, which you should read when they are presented to you.
            You will have the opportunity to review and confirm your order, including delivery address (if applicable), payment method and product details. A notice will be communicated to you when your order is accepted and our acceptance will be deemed complete and for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to you at the time the notice is sent. At such time, the contract for sale will be made and become binding. The risk of loss in any goods you purchase and the responsibility to insure them passes to you when the relevant goods are delivered.
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order prior to delivery. Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include system or typographical errors, inaccuracies in product or pricing information or product availability, fairness among customers where supplies are limited, or problems identified by our credit or fraud departments. We also may require additional verification or information before accepting an order. We will contact you if any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is cancelled after we have processed your payment but prior to delivery, we will refund your payment.
            
            When you provide payment information, you represent and warrant that the information is accurate, that you are authorized to use the payment method provided, and that you will notify us of changes to the payment information. We reserve the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards.
            
            RENEWAL POLICY FOR AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS
            We will charge or debit your payment method at the beginning of your membership subscription. When we renew your membership subscription, we will use the payment method currently associated with your account. If your credit or debit account has been closed or your payment method is otherwise invalid, your membership subscription may not renew and your membership will be cancelled. If we are unable to collect payment prior to your renewal date, and you wish to retain your membership subscription, you will be subject to current payment plan offerings. In certain cases, such as an expired card, our payment processor will contact the card issuing bank for updated information to allow the purchase to go through. 
            Until you cancel your membership subscription, billing will continue according to the cycle stated at the time of your purchase. The Cancellation and Refund Policy for membership subscriptions explained below applies to all Green Again membership tiers.
            
            REFUND AND CANCELLATION POLICY
